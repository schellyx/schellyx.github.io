                Hi everyone, my name is Michelle. I'm 25, i live in Germany and my Dream is to become a Software
                engineer.
                I started my IT Journey in 2022 where i worked as a 1st-level-support. Really quick i discovered my love
                for the IT, i wanted to learn everything that crossed my path.
                That was the beginning of so many restless nights where i read every articel an watched thousands of
                Videos, just to understand how everything works.
                After one year i found myself in a Job at the 2nd-level-support but i'm not at the Position i want to
                be.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know my skills are not the same Level as someone who Studied Computer science but i refuse to let my
                dreams down because of that. I'm willing and capable of learning everything that is needed! So i hope
                you are the one who gives me a chance to grow and learn.
            </p>
